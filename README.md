# IT-Tier-II-Support-Quests
Documenting my quests throughout this tier II role. 

# 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Angel Vacacela**, an enthusiastic and driven IT Support Specialist with over **2 years** of hands-on experience in helpdesk and infrastructure support. I'm currently employed at **Open Door Family Medical Center**, where I provide **Tier II technical support**, while actively shadowing and collaborating with system administrators and network engineers to deepen my expertise.

My IT journey began at **Eyeclick by Beam**, a high-volume remote support role where I was part of a 3-person team providing nationwide support for proprietary gaming devices (Raspberry Pi & Dell OptiPlex-based), used by brands like **McDonald’s** and **Burger King**. This experience instilled in me the **work ethic and discipline** needed to handle complex, fast-paced environments.

I later joined the **New Rochelle City School District** as a **Junior Network Specialist**, supporting:
- 1 High School  
- 2 Middle Schools  
- 5 Elementary Schools  
- Over 400 Staff  

I provided full-spectrum IT support and worked closely with the district's Network Engineer to support **Aruba wireless infrastructure**, **ClearPass authentication**, and manage **10,000+ Chromebooks**.

### 🛠️ Key Highlights:
- Installed, configured, and maintained **Aruba CX switches** and **Campus Access Points** across the district  
- Troubleshot **RADIUS (AAA)** authentication issues for wireless connectivity  
- Supported live **Board of Education meetings** via **Zoom Live** and **YouTube Live**  
- Managed IT inventory using **Snipe-IT** and Google Admin Console  

After nearly 1.5 years, I stepped away to handle personal matters abroad. During that time, I **earned my Security+ and CCNA certifications**, studying rigorously to ensure I’d come back stronger.

Shortly after returning to NY, I joined **Stamford Health** (through MedaSource) for a **6-week contract**, preparing for the **Epic EHR migration** across all hospital locations.

### 🖥️ Responsibilities Included:
- Deploying and configuring hardware (workstations, peripherals)  
- Supporting integration with existing network infrastructure  
- Documenting deployments and troubleshooting processes for internal IT

# 🚀 Why This GitHub Exists

This repo isn’t just a portfolio — it’s a **log of discipline**.

I use it to:
- 📓 Document real-world IT support scenarios and technical wins  
- 🧠 Reflect on areas I want to grow: networking, security, sysadmin  
- 📈 Build momentum toward **higher-paying, higher-responsibility infrastructure roles**

I’ve learned that it’s easier to document your wins in the moment than to try and remember them months later. That’s why I write them down here — so I can **track my growth** and **stay sharp** for the next opportunity.

I’m hungry to grow — to take on bigger challenges, collaborate with smarter minds, and build real impact.

If you’re reading this... thank you.  
**I’m just getting started.**
