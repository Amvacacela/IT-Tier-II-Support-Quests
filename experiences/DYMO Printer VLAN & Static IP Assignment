# 🏥 Open Door Family Medical Center – Experience Log
**Role:** Tier II Technician  
**Duration:** April 2024 – Present  
**Location:** New York


## 📅 August 5, 2025 – DYMO Printer VLAN & Static IP Assignment

Provisioned 12 DYMO 550 network printers for a new Open Door medical site. Verified VLAN assignments and configured static IPs.

- Used `ipconfig /all` on wall jacks to identify VLANs:
  - `10.5.5.x` = data VLAN
  - `169.x.x.x` = printer VLAN (no DHCP)
- Traced jacks to switchports; provided info to network engineer
- Shadowed engineer on FortiGate to observe VLAN port reassignment
- Verified APIPA IP post-change to confirm VLAN reassignment
- Assigned static IPs to printers, tracked in Excel
- Shared IP tracker with sysadmin; mapped printers to AVD hosts

> **Result:** All 12 printers configured with correct static IPs on the printer VLAN; deployment completed on time  
> **Skills:** [Networking] [VLANs] [Static IP Config] [Collaboration]  
> **Growth:** Automate tracking; request deeper switch CLI exposure
